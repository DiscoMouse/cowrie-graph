# üìä Cowrie-Graph

![Status: Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work%20in%20progress-yellow)

A modern, secure, and performant web-based dashboard for visualizing data from the [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie) SSH & Telnet honeypot.

This project is a spiritual successor to the original [kippo-graph](https://github.com/ikoniaris/kippo-graph), built from the ground up with a secure Go backend and an interactive Apache ECharts frontend.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status

**This project has a working Minimum Viable Product (MVP).** Core features for visualizing honeypot data are functional. The application is still under active development and should be considered **Alpha** quality. The backend architecture has been refactored for maintainability.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have a working Cowrie honeypot installation that is actively logging to a MySQL database. `cowrie-graph` is a visualization tool for an existing setup.

1.  **A running Cowrie instance.**
2.  **Cowrie configured for MySQL output.** Follow the [Official Cowrie SQL Documentation](https://docs.cowrie.org/en/latest/sql/README.html) to set up the database schema and configure `cowrie.cfg`.
3.  **A dedicated MySQL user for `cowrie-graph`.** This application requires its own database user with `SELECT` permissions on the Cowrie database and `ALL PRIVILEGES` on its own `ip_intelligence` table, which it will create automatically.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DiscoMouse/cowrie-graph.git
    cd cowrie-graph
    ```

2.  **GeoIP Database (Manual Step):** This project uses the free MaxMind GeoLite2 City database for IP geolocation. Due to licensing, you must download this yourself.
    * Sign up for a free [MaxMind GeoLite2 account](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup).
    * Log in and navigate to "Download Databases".
    * Download the **"GeoLite2 City"** database in the **`GeoIP2 / MMDB`** format.
    * Extract the archive and place the `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` file in the root of this project directory.

3.  **Configuration:**
    * Copy the example configuration file:
        ```bash
        cp config.example.json config.json
        ```
    * Edit `config.json` and enter the MySQL database connection details for the dedicated user you created.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/web
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`. The first time it runs, it will automatically create the `ip_intelligence` table in your database.

## ‚úÖ Current Features

* **Multi-Page Dashboard:** A clean, responsive UI with separate, detailed pages for different data views.
* **Light/Dark Mode:** A theme toggle with the user's preference saved in their browser.
* **Secure API Backend:** All data is served via a secure, API-driven backend written in Go using the Gin framework.
* **Organized Codebase:** The backend logic is organized into a clean, package-based architecture.
* **Data Enrichment & Geo-Intelligence:**
    * Automatic GeoIP lookup for attacker IPs using a local MaxMind GeoLite2 database.
    * An internal caching system (`ip_intelligence` table) to prevent redundant lookups.
* **Time-Series Charts:** Interactive, zoomable charts for daily and monthly attack trends.
* **Top 20 Statistics Pages:**
    * A dedicated page for attack vectors (Passwords, Usernames, IPs, SSH Clients).
    * A dedicated page for Geo-statistics (Countries, Cities, ISPs/Organizations).
* **Dynamic Visualizations:** Animated bar race charts for top attacking IPs and countries.

## üôè Inspiration & Credit

This project would not exist without the pioneering work of the original [kippo-graph](https://github.com/ikoniaris/kippo-graph) team. Their tool was the standard for visualizing Kippo and early Cowrie data for many years, and this project aims to build upon their legacy using modern technologies and security practices.
