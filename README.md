# üìä Cowrie-Graph

![Status: Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work%20in%20progress-yellow)

A modern, secure, and performant web-based dashboard for visualizing data from the [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie) SSH & Telnet honeypot.

This project is a spiritual successor to the original `kippo-graph`, built from the ground up with a secure Go backend and an interactive Apache ECharts frontend.

## üôè Inspiration & Credit

This project would not exist without the pioneering work of the original `kippo-graph` team. Their tool was the standard for visualizing Kippo and early Cowrie data for many years, and this project aims to build upon their legacy using modern technologies and security practices.
