Thank you for using Cowrie-Graph!

It looks like this is your first time running the application in this directory.

A 'config.example.json' file has been created for you.

Next Steps:
1. Copy 'config.example.json' to 'config.json'.
2. Edit 'config.json' with your MySQL database details.
3. Download the GeoLite2-City.mmdb file from MaxMind (see the main project README for instructions) and place it in this directory.
4. Run the 'cowrie-graph' executable again to start the server.
